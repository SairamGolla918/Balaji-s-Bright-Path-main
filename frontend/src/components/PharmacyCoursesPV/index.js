</h1>
<br />
<h2>
	Definition and Classification of Adverse Drug Reactions
</h2>
<p>
	<strong>
		Definition:
	</strong>
	 Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are unwanted or harmful reactions that occur as a result of the use of a pharmaceutical product at normal doses for prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a medical condition.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		Classification:
	</strong>
	 ADRs are categorized based on their nature and relationship to drug use. Common classifications include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Type A (Augmented): Predictable reactions resulting from the pharmacological action of the drug. Usually dose-dependent.
	</li>
	<li>
		Type B (Bizarre): Unpredictable reactions unrelated to the drug's known pharmacological actions. Often idiosyncratic and not dose-dependent.
	</li>
	<li>
		Type C (Chronic): Reactions occurring after long-term use of the drug.
	</li>
	<li>
		Type D (Delayed): Reactions that manifest after a significant time lag from drug exposure.
	</li>
	<li>
		Type E (End of Use): Reactions occurring upon withdrawal of the drug.
	</li>
	<li>
		Type F (Failure): Reactions due to drug ineffectiveness.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>
	Types and Severity of ADRs
</h2>
<p>
	ADRs can manifest in various ways and may range from mild to severe. Common types of ADRs include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Gastrointestinal Reactions: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
	</li>
	<li>
		Skin Reactions: Rash, itching, hives.
	</li>
	<li>
		Neurological Reactions: Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
	</li>
	<li>
		Respiratory Reactions: Cough, difficulty breathing.
	</li>
	<li>
		Cardiovascular Reactions: Hypotension, palpitations.
	</li>
	<li>
		Hematological Reactions: Anemia, leukopenia.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Severity of ADRs can range from mild, self-limiting reactions to life-threatening conditions requiring immediate medical attention.
</p>
<h2>
	Factors Influencing ADR Occurrence
</h2>
<p>
	<strong>
		Patient Characteristics:
	</strong>
	 Factors such as age, sex, genetic makeup, and underlying medical conditions can influence an individual's susceptibility to ADRs.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		Drug Interactions:
	</strong>
	 Concomitant use of multiple medications may lead to interactions that increase the risk of ADRs.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		Dosage and Duration:
	</strong>
	 The dose and duration of drug use can affect the likelihood of experiencing ADRs.
</p>
<h2>
	Reporting and Documentation of ADRs

<h2>
	Integration of Pharmacovigilance and Medical Information Functions
</h2>
<p>
	Pharmacovigilance and medical information functions are closely integrated to ensure comprehensive safety information dissemination. The integration includes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Collaboration between pharmacovigilance teams and medical information teams to provide accurate and timely responses to inquiries.
	</li>
	<li>
		Sharing safety data and information between both functions to improve decision-making processes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Medical information teams providing support for pharmacovigilance activities, such as providing product information to healthcare professionals.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>
	Medical Information Support for Adverse Event Inquiries
</h2>
<p>
	Medical information teams play a vital role in handling adverse event inquiries from healthcare professionals and patients. Their support includes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Responding to inquiries related to drug safety, side effects, and interactions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Providing guidance on how to report adverse events to the pharmacovigilance team.
	</li>
	<li>
		Collecting relevant information from the inquirer to assist in the adverse event reporting process.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>
	Medical Review of Safety Data
</h2>
<p>
	Medical review is an essential part of pharmacovigilance, involving in-depth assessment of safety data. The medical review includes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Evaluating individual case safety reports (ICSRs) to determine the causality, severity, and expectedness of adverse events.
	</li>
	<li>
		Reviewing aggregate safety data to identify potential safety signals and trends.
	</li>
	<li>
		Collaborating with medical experts and regulatory authorities for safety assessments.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>
	Medical Writing and Documentation in Pharmacovigilance
</h2>
<p>
	Medical writing is crucial for documenting pharmacovigilance activities and safety findings. Key aspects of medical writing in pharmacovigilance include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Preparing periodic safety reports (PSURs) and other regulatory safety documents.
	</li>
	<li>
		Writing safety summaries for investigational and marketed products.
	</li>
	<li>
		Documenting safety-related decisions, risk management plans, and risk-benefit assessments.
	</li>
</ul>
